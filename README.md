# Solidity Fuzzing Challenge: Foundry vs Echidna vs Medusa (plus Halmos & Certora) #

A comparison of solidity fuzzing tools [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), [Echidna](https://secure-contracts.com/program-analysis/echidna/index.html) & [Medusa](https://github.com/crytic/medusa) also considering Formal Verification tools such as [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos) and [Certora](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/tutorials.html). This challenge set is not intended to be an academically rigorous benchmark but rather to present the experiences of an auditor "in the trenches"; the primary goal is finding the best performance "out of the box" with as little guidance & tweaking as possible.

Many of the challenges are simplified versions of audit findings from my private audits at [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io). These findings could have been found by the protocol developers themselves prior to an external audit if the protocol had written the correct [fuzz testing invariants](https://dacian.me/find-highs-before-external-auditors-using-invariant-fuzz-testing). Hence a secondary goal of this repo is to show developers how to write better fuzz testing invariants to improve their protocol security prior to engaging external auditors.

## Setup ##

Ensure you are using recent versions of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Medusa](https://github.com/crytic/medusa).

Configure [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) for Echidna & Medusa:

`solc-select install 0.8.23`\
`solc-select use 0.8.23`

To compile this project:

`forge build`

Every exercise has a `basic` configuration and/or `advanced` fuzz configuration for Foundry, Echidna & Medusa. The `basic` configuration does not guide the fuzzer at all; it simply sets up the scenario and allows the fuzzer to do whatever it wants. The `advanced` configuration guides the fuzzer to the functions it should call and helps to eliminate invalid inputs which result in useless fuzz runs.

## Results ##

### Challenge #1 Naive Receiver: (Winner TIED ALL) ###

In `basic` configuration Foundry, Echidna & Medusa are able to break the simpler invariant but not the more valuable and difficult one. In `advanced` configuration all 3 fuzzers can break both invariants. All 3 fuzzers reduce the exploit chain to a very concise & optimized transaction set and present this to the user in an easy to understand output. As a result they are tied and there is no clear winner.

### Challenge #2 Unstoppable: (Winner TIED ALL) ###

All Fuzzers in `basic` configuration can break both invariants; Foundry appears to be the slightly faster.

### Challenge #3 Proposal: (Winner TIED ALL) ###

Foundry, Echidna & Medusa in `basic` mode are able to easily break the invariant, resulting in a tie.

### Challenge #4 Voting NFT: (Winner TIED ALL) ###

In `basic` configuration Foundry, Echidna & Medusa are all able to break the easier invariant but not the more difficult one. All Fuzzers are able to provide the user with a minimal transaction set to generate the exploit. Hence they are tied, there is no clear winner.

### Challenge #5 Token Sale: (Winner MEDUSA) ###

In `basic` configuration Foundry & Echidna can only break the easier and more valuable invariant which leads to a Critical exploit but not the harder though less valuable invariant which leads to a High/Medium. However Medusa is able to almost immediately break both invariants in unguided `basic` mode, making Medusa the clear winner.

### Challenge #6 Rarely False: (Winner TIED HALMOS & CERTORA) ###

Both Echidna & Foundry are unable to break the assertion in this stateless fuzzing challenge. Medusa [used](https://twitter.com/DevDacian/status/1732199452344221913) to be able to break it almost instantly but has [regressed](https://github.com/crytic/medusa/issues/305) in performance after recent changes and is now unable to break it. Halmos and Certora can break it so they are the winners.

### Challenge #7 Byte Battle: (Winner TIED FOUNDRY, ECHIDNA, HALMOS, CERTORA)

Foundry & Echidna are able to break the assertion in this stateless fuzzing challenge, but Medusa is [unable](https://github.com/crytic/medusa/issues/307) to break it.

### Challenge #8 Omni Protocol: (Winner MEDUSA)

All 3 Fuzzers configured in `advanced` guided mode attempted to break 16 invariants on Beta Finance [Omni Protocol](https://github.com/beta-finance/Omni-Protocol). Medusa is typically able to break 2 invariants within 5 minutes (often much sooner on subsequent runs) though on the first run can take a bit longer. Echidna can sometimes break 1 invariant within 5 minutes and Foundry appears to never be able to break any invariants within 5 minutes. Hence Medusa is the clear winner. The fuzzers written for this challenge were [contributed](https://github.com/beta-finance/Omni-Protocol/pull/2) to Beta Finance.

### Challenge #9 -> #14

Some additional solvers have been added based upon real-world findings from my private audits.
